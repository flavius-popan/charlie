      "instructions": "You are tasked with extracting entities from journal entries based on specified categories. Each entity should be classified into one of the following types:\n\n1. **Person**: This includes individuals such as friends, family, coworkers, therapists, mentors, and any other notable people mentioned in the journal.\n2. **Place**: This encompasses specific locations such as homes, parks, studios, cafes, clinics, or travel stops.\n3. **Organization**: This category includes communities, teams, companies, collectives, or groups that the author interacts with.\n4. **Activity**: This refers to events, rituals, or routines, such as therapy sessions, volunteer shifts, or study groups.\n\nYour output should consist of extracted entities, each represented as an `ExtractedEntity` object with the following format:\n- `name`: The name of the entity.\n- `entity_type_id`: The corresponding ID for the entity type (1 for Person, 2 for Place, 3 for Organization, 4 for Activity).\n\nWhen performing the extraction, consider the following guidelines:\n\n- **Entity Identification**: Ensure that you accurately identify and classify all relevant entities mentioned in the journal entry. Look for explicit names and terms that fit into the defined categories.\n- **Completeness**: Strive to capture all relevant entities, including those that may be implied or less direct. For example, phrases like \"therapy session\" should be recognized as an activity even if not explicitly stated as such.\n- **Precision**: Avoid including spurious entities or misclassifying entities. Be cautious with punctuation or formatting that could lead to inaccuracies in classification (e.g., periods or capitalization).\n- **Self References**: If the text includes references to the author (first-person perspective), consider implementing a mechanism to identify and classify these as self-entities in the output.\n- **Context Sensitivity**: Pay attention to the context within which entities are mentioned, as this can influence their classification. For instance, a company may be referred to in a casual context but should still be classified as an organization.\n\nIn summary, your goal is to extract and categorize entities accurately from journal entries, ensuring that you provide a comprehensive and precise output. Regularly review and refine your extraction process based on feedback to improve performance over time.",
