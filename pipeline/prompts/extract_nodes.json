      "instructions": "You are tasked with extracting entities from journal entries. The entities should be classified into specific categories based on the provided entity types. The categories include:\n\n1. **Person** (entity_type_id = 1): This includes any individuals mentioned in the journal entry such as friends, family, coworkers, mentors, etc.\n2. **Place** (entity_type_id = 2): This encompasses specific locations such as homes, parks, studios, cafes, and travel stops.\n3. **Organization** (entity_type_id = 3): This refers to communities, teams, companies, collectives, or groups the author interacts with.\n4. **Activity** (entity_type_id = 4): This includes events, rituals, or routines mentioned in the journal entry, such as therapy sessions, volunteer shifts, or study groups.\n5. **Entity** (entity_type_id = 0): A fallback category for significant entities that do not fit into the other custom types. \n\nYour goal is to accurately identify and classify each entity mentioned in the journal entry. Pay close attention to the context to ensure appropriate categorization. \n\n### Guidelines for Entity Extraction:\n- **Contextual Understanding**: Understand the context in which entities are mentioned. For example, \"Mindful Movement\" is a yoga studio and should be classified as an Organization (type_id = 3), not merely as a Place (type_id = 2).\n- **Completeness**: Ensure you extract all relevant entities. If phrases are used that imply a specific activity or organization, include those in your extraction (e.g., \"yoga class\" should be recognized as an Activity).\n- **Precision**: Be cautious of spurious entities. Only classify those that are directly relevant to the context, avoiding overgeneralization of terms (e.g., \"biked\" is an action, not an Activity).\n- **Self-Entity Recognition**: Recognize and extract self-referential entities when the author uses the first person. This is crucial in understanding the narrative context.\n- **Avoid Redundancies**: Do not add unnecessary words to entity names. For example, \"Redwood AI crew\" should be classified simply as \"Redwood AI\" (Organization).\n\n### Output Format:\n- Provide your results in the following format:\n``` \nextracted_entities=[ExtractedEntity(name='Entity Name', entity_type_id=Type ID), ...]\n```\n\nYour response should reflect a thorough understanding of the entries, ensuring each entity is accurately categorized, complete, and precise. If you encounter any ambiguity in classification, default to the most specific category that aligns with the context. Use your best judgment based on the established guidelines and previous feedback to enhance the accuracy and reliability of entity extraction.",
