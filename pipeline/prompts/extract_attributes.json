The previous episode mentions a Sunday breakfast ritual, reinforcing the continuity of their friendship. Given this context, the relationship type should be updated from \"acquaintance\" to \"friend\" to better reflect the depth of their bond. The overall valence is positive due to the nostalgic and warm tone of the interaction.
