      "instructions": "Task description\n- Generate a concise, journal-style entity summary from the provided journal-context data.\n\nInput format (consistent with your samples)\n- summary_context is a JSON object containing:\n  - node: { name, summary, entity_types (list), attributes (key-value map) }\n  - episode_content: string\n  - previous_episodes: list of strings\n\nWhat to produce\n- Output a single short summary (typically 1–2 sentences, about 15–40 words) that encapsulates the key thread of the latest episode content and its relation to the entity in the node.\n- Keep the output as plain text (no code blocks, no extra formatting).\n\n Voice and tone\n- Default to first-person, intimate journal tone for journal-style entries (use “I” or “we” and mention the subject when appropriate).\n- If a user explicitly requests a third-person or neutral tone, provide that instead. Do not mix voices in a single summary.\n\nContent to cover\n- Identify the main entity from node.name and its type from node.entity_types, and reflect any relevant attributes (e.g., relationship_type, location like a hospital, activity like surgery prep, or mood cues from attributes).\n- Describe the core action or state from episode_content (e.g., caregiving actions, medical steps, emotions, tasks being done).\n- If previous_episodes carry a clear through-line, optionally acknowledge it briefly (one clause) but keep the focus on the current episode.\n- Mention explicit names or places when they are central to the episode (e.g., a person like “Mom” or a place like “St. Jude’s”), but avoid introducing new details not present in the input.\n\nExact phrasing and keyword alignment\n- Preserve exact multi-word phrases that appear in the input when they are meaningful keywords or domain terms (e.g., “waiting room care,” “mint tea,” “Mom,” “surgery prep,” “St. Jude’s”).\n- If such exact phrases exist in episode_content or attributes, include them verbatim in the summary and place them prominently when possible.\n\nConciseness and clarity\n- Prefer concise, easy-to-read wording. Avoid unnecessary adjectives or speculation.\n- If the content is ambiguous, state the interpretation briefly and limit hedging (e.g., “appears to be…” only if clearly warranted by the input).\n\nFormatting details\n- Return only the summary text. Do not include labels like “summary:” or JSON.\n- Use proper capitalization and punctuation; keep sentences clean and direct.\n\nQuality checks\n- Ensure the summary centers on the target entity (node.name) and accurately reflects the episode content.\n- Avoid inventing events, people, or places not present in summary_context or episode_content.\n- If the episode_content mentions a specific action (e.g., “reorganized pamphlets”) or state (e.g., “recovering”), capture that action/state succinctly.\n\nOptional guidance for advanced use\n- If a user asks for a variant, provide both:\n  - A first-person journal version (default).\n  - A concise third-person summary (only if requested).\n- If the input lacks explicit keywords or phrases, rely on the core content to describe the scene and relationships without forcing phrases.\n\nExamples (non-exhaustive)\n- When node.name = \"Harbor Clinic\" and episode_content mentions a reorganization to improve waiting room care and a mint tea scent, produce a concise first-person line highlighting the clinic, its scent, and the improvement to waiting room care.\n- When node.name = \"Grandma Rosa\" and the episode shows caregiving, include a brief first-person note about caring for Grandma Rosa, possibly mentioning “Dr. Yates” or “St. Jude’s” if present in the content.\n\nIf you need a different style (more factual, more poetic, or strictly neutral), specify the desired tone and I will adapt.",
