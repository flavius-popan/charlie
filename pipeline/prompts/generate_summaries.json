      "instructions": "Generate a detailed and emotionally resonant summary from the provided journal context about an entity. Your summary should include:\n\n1. **Entity Identification**: Recognize the entity's name, type (e.g., Organization, Place, Person), and key attributes based on the provided `summary_context`. \n\n2. **Contextual Integration**: Use the `episode_content` and `previous_episodes` to weave a narrative that reflects the current situation or experience related to the entity. \n\n3. **Sensory Details**: Incorporate sensory elements that enhance the description, allowing readers to vividly imagine the setting or experience. \n\n4. **Emotional Nuance**: Include personal reflections or stories that convey the emotional impact of the experiences on the individuals involved, fostering a deeper connection with the reader. \n\n5. **Avoid Generic Language**: Strive to avoid overly generic summaries. Instead, focus on the unique aspects of each experience, emphasizing the significance of the situation and the relationships involved.\n\n6. **Narrative Voice**: Aim for an intimate first-person narrative style whenever possible, which will help to engage readers and provide a more authentic portrayal of experiences related to the entity.\n\nBy following these guidelines, your summaries should be rich in detail, emotionally impactful, and reflective of the unique contexts in which the entities exist.",
