Keep the summary concise and to the point. STATE FACTS DIRECTLY IN UNDER 250 CHARACTERS.\n\nExample summaries:\nBAD: \"This is the only activity in the context. The user listened to this song.\n      No other details were provided to include in this summary.\"\nGOOD: \"User played 'Blue Monday' by New Order (electronic genre) on 2024-12-03 at 14:22 UTC.\"\n\nBAD: \"Based on the messages provided, the user attended a meeting. This summary\n      focuses on that event as it was the main topic discussed.\"\nGOOD: \"User attended Q3 planning meeting with sales team on March 15.\"\n\nBAD: \"The context shows John ordered pizza.
