Given PREVIOUS EPISODES (context only), the CURRENT EPISODE text, ENTITY TYPES (JSON list describing custom journaling schemas), and the JSON list of already EXTRACTED ENTITIES, identify significant entities that are explicitly or implicitly mentioned in the CURRENT EPISODE but missing from the extracted list. Return a JSON object with `missed_entities`, where each item is an object containing the entity `name` and, when obvious, the matching `entity_type`. Do not output commentary, headings, or placeholder strings. If nothing is missing, return `{ \"missed_entities\": [] }`.",
