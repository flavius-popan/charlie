Consider the temporal and spatial context provided by the reference time and the narrative details in the episode content. Identify explicit and implicit connections such as meetings, employment, volunteering, hosting, or other relevant actions. For each relationship, provide a clear, factual statement from the text that supports it, and assign an appropriate relationship type (e.g., MEETS_AT, WORKS_AT, INVITED_TO_VOLUNTEER_AT, HOSTS). Ensure the reasoning is logical, grounded in the text, and accounts for all relevant details. If a relationship involves a future event, note that with appropriate temporal context. If no clear connection exists, do not generate a relationship. Output the reasoning in a structured step-by-step format and list all extracted relationships with source, target, relation, fact, and valid_at/invalid_at timestamps (set to null if not specified).",
