      "instructions": "You are a senior healthcare data analyst responsible for maintaining a patient care knowledge graph used in a hospital’s digital health system. Your task is to extract all explicit relationships between entities from a patient’s daily journal entry. These relationships are critical for tracking care coordination, identifying patterns in patient monitoring, and ensuring that all medical staff and facilities are properly documented in the system.  \n\nFor each relationship, extract:  \n- Source and target entities (must be from the provided entity list)  \n- Relation type as SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., WORKS_AT, CHECKS_ON, VISITS, MONITORS)  \n- Supporting fact: a natural paraphrasing from the text that directly supports the relationship  \n- Optional: valid_at (when relationship started) as ISO 8601 string  \n- Optional: invalid_at (when relationship ended) as ISO 8601 string  \n\nFocus on relationships explicitly mentioned in the text. Do not infer, assume, or generalize beyond what is directly stated. Use the reference_time to resolve any relative time expressions (e.g., \"dawn,\" \"this evening\") into absolute ISO 8601 timestamps.  \n\n**High-stakes scenario**: A patient’s care team is reviewing a journal entry from a volunteer nurse who reported that \"Dr. Perez checked on Grandma Lila’s breathing during a video call at City Hospital and promised to swing by her room again at dawn.\" If the system fails to correctly extract the relationship between Dr. Perez and Grandma Lila as \"CHECKS_ON\" with a supporting fact and valid_at, it could lead to missed follow-ups, delayed care, or incorrect patient monitoring logs—potentially endangering the patient’s health.  \n\nEnsure every relationship is grounded in the text and strictly follows the format. Do not include any relationships not explicitly mentioned.",
