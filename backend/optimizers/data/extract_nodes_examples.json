Kenji came by later which was actually perfect timing - forgot how much I missed just shooting the shit with him. Talked for like 2 hours about everything, his job stuff, my situation with Priya, life. He's good at listening without trying to fix things you know?\n\nDid a meditation after he left. Needed to get out of my head.\n\nMet up with Wei for a late lunch at Tamarind Kitchen. Hadn't seen them since the wedding and it was nice to catch up one on one without the wedding crew being chaotic. They're thinking about moving back to Vancouver which is wild, always assumed they'd be here forever.",

Food was overpriced for what it was but whatever, I needed to get out of my apartment before I lost my mind.\n\nYuki's going through it rn, her situationship with that guy from her job finally imploded. Dmitri and I just listened and nodded for like an hour straight. The broke bitches do what we do best. Then she found some random bookstore downtown and completely forgot she was sad, spent 20 mins digging through shelves for a copy of Acts of Service. We just stood there like ok I guess were doing this now. Got boba after because I already blew my budget so why not.

Finally got to do actual patient care after lunch which is the part I actually like about this job.\n\nFatima from pharmacy came up to discuss new medication protocol. I like working with her, she is thorough, checks everything twice. We went over the changes together, took longer than expected but worth it. Omar caught me later in the hallway, stressed about staffing again. Short two nurses next month. I told him we will manage, we always do. But honestly I am tired of always managing.\n\nTook a few minutes for Asr prayer in the break room after Omar left. Needed to clear my head.\n\nLeft late to pick up Sana from dance practice at Encore Academy. She was quiet in the car which is not like her, usually talks the whole way home about the dance team and what everyone is working on. I ask whats wrong and she gives me the \"I'm fine\" with that voice. You cannot push teenagers, learned this the hard way. So I just drove and let the quiet be quiet. After dinner we played backgammon like we used to when she was little. She won twice. Watched an episode of The Bear together after, nice to see her smile again.",
