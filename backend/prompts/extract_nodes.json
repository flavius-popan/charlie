Strip leading verbs: \"listening to X\" → \"X\", \"going to X\" → \"X\", \"watching X\" → \"X\", \"eating at X\" → \"X\"\n- Strip time prefixes: \"morning walk\" → \"walk\", \"evening yoga\" → \"yoga\"\n\n### Entity Types:\n1. **Person**: Named individuals (\"Nina\", \"Dr. Smith\")\n2. **Place**: Named venues/locations (\"Pho 75\", \"Kestrel Ridge\")\n3. **Group**: Named teams/clubs/organizations (\"trail runners group\")\n4. **Activity**: Named events/routines as NOUNS (\"brunch\", \"hike\", \"yoga\")\n\n### Instructions:\n- Look for compound names (e.g., \"Dr. Smith\") and informal group names\n- Normalize typos for consistency\n- Avoid over-classification; use the most specific type",
