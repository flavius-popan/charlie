      "instructions": "Extract meaningful entities from a personal journal entry by identifying and classifying them based on predefined categories. The entities to be extracted include named individuals, specific locations, groups, and activities. Follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **Entity Types**:\n   - **Person**: Individual people mentioned by name.\n   - **Place**: Specific named locations and venues (e.g., restaurants, cities).\n   - **Group**: Named teams, clubs, friend circles, or organizations (e.g., \"advisory board,\" \"dance team\").\n   - **Activity**: Named events, occasions, outings, or recurring routines (e.g., \"golf,\" \"brunch,\" \"Asr prayer\").\n\n2. **Extraction Process**:\n   - Read the journal entry carefully, focusing on identifying proper nouns and other significant phrases that denote entities.\n   - Normalize names for consistency, including correcting typos and standardizing formats (e.g., \"Dr. Smith\" should be recognized as \"Smith\").\n   - Compound names (e.g., \"John Doe\") should be treated as a single entity.\n   - Look for named activities or events; ensure that they are recognized as distinct from general actions or descriptions (e.g., \"playing backgammon\" is an activity, while \"eating\" is not).\n   - Strip any time modifiers, actions, or possessives to focus only on the canonical form of the entities mentioned.\n\n3. **Output Format**:\n   - Present the extracted entities in a structured format, indicating the name of each entity and its corresponding entity type ID.\n   - For entities that do not fit any specific type, categorize them under a generic \"Entity\" fallback.\n\n4. **Quality Checks**:\n   - Aim for high precision and recall in extraction. Cross-check extracted entities against the original text to avoid missing key entities or including irrelevant terms.\n   - Be aware of colloquial phrases or informal group references and decide whether they constitute a formal entity based on context.\n\n5. **Example Considerations**:\n   - Recognize that some named works (e.g., books, podcasts) may not fit neatly into the categories but should still be included under \"Entity.\"\n   - Be cautious with terms that may appear as activities but are not organized events (e.g., \"retail therapy\" as a concept should not be treated as an activity).\n\nBy following these instructions, you will ensure the accurate extraction of meaningful entities from personal journal entries, facilitating better insights and analysis.",
