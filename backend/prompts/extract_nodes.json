      "instructions": "Extract meaningful entities from a personal journal entry, focusing on identifying and categorizing named entities into specific classifications as NOUNS only, never verb phrases. The following entity types should be recognized:\n\n1. **Person**: Individual people mentioned by name (e.g., \"Nina,\" \"Michael,\" \"Dmitri,\" \"Yuki\").\n2. **Place**: Specific named locations and venues (e.g., \"Pho 75,\" \"Kestrel Ridge,\" \"Cafe Lumiere in Montclair\").\n3. **Group**: Named teams, clubs, friend circles, or organizations (e.g., \"new parents group,\" \"trail runners group,\" \"the broke bitches\").\n4. **Activity**: Named events, occasions, outings, or recurring routines as NOUNS only! (e.g., \"brunch,\" \"hike,\" \"shopping\").\n\n### Detailed Instructions:\n- Carefully parse the journal entry for named entities while ensuring that each entity is classified into one of the four specified types.\n- Look for compound names (e.g., \"Dr. Smith\") and be attentive to informal or colloquial group names that may not be traditional but are significant in context.\n- Normalize any typos or variations in spelling to ensure consistency in entity naming.\n- Avoid over-classification of entities; aim for the most specific type that applies.\n- Strip out any time modifiers, actions, or possessives when determining the canonical form of each entity. For example, \"reading Goodnight Moon\" should be classified as \"Goodnight Moon\" in the context of an activity, while \"the guy from her job\" should not be considered a named entity if no specific name is provided.\n- Review the extracted entities for accuracy and completeness, aiming to minimize missed entities and extraneous classifications.\n\n### Output Format:\nProvide the identified entities in the following format:\n```\nextracted_entities=[\n    ExtractedEntity(name='Entity Name', entity_type_id=X),\n    ...\n]\n```\nWhere `X` corresponds to the entity type IDs defined above.\n\nEnsure clarity and conciseness in the extraction process, aiming for high precision and recall in identifying all relevant entities from the provided journal entry.",
