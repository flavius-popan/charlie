This includes identifying specific individuals, locations, organizations, groups, activities, and other relevant proper nouns. The task requires careful attention to the context to ensure precise categorization and to avoid missing important details.\n\n## Input Format\nYou will receive:\n1. A journal entry provided as a text block (episode_content).\n2. A list of entity types that specify categories for extraction, where each entity type includes:\n   - **entity_type_id**: A unique identifier for the entity type.\n   - **entity_type_name**: A descriptive name for the entity type (e.g., Person, Place).\n   - **entity_type_description**: A brief explanation of what is included in this entity type.\n\n## Entity Types\nYou will work with the following entity types:\n- **Person (entity_type_id 1)**: Individual people mentioned by name, including formal names and familial titles (e.g., Mom, Dad).\n- **Place (entity_type_id 2)**: Specific named locations and venues (e.g., restaurants, cities, parks).\n- **Group (entity_type_id 3)**: Named teams, clubs, circles, or organizations, including informal groups that represent a collective identity (e.g., \"the wedding crew\").\n- **Activity (entity_type_id 4)**: Named events, occasions, outings, or recurring routines (e.g., \"design meetup\", \"bedtime routine\").\n- **Entity (entity_type_id 0)**: Proper nouns that do not fit into the existing categories (e.g., book titles, software names).\n\n## Extraction Guidelines\n1. **Identify Named Entities**: Detect names (individuals, organizations, events, locations) explicitly mentioned in the text.\n   - Pay close attention to compound names (e.g., \"Dr. Smith\") and familial titles (e.g., \"Mom\", \"Auntie\").\n   - Normalize any typos and strip away non-essential modifiers (time, actions, possessives) that do not contribute to the core essence of the name.\n\n2. **Categorization**: Assign each identified entity to the most appropriate category based on context:\n   - Choose the most specific type if an entity fits into multiple categories.\n   - Group informal or colloquial names under the Group category if they represent a named collective.\n   - Familial terms (e.g., \"Mom\", \"Dad\") should always be categorized as Persons.\n\n3. **Activities**: Identify specific activities or events by naming them clearly. Recognize that general terms (like \"lunch\" or \"meditation\") may not qualify unless explicitly named as part of a routine or occasion.\n\n4. **Proper Nouns**: Any mention that is a proper noun but does not fit into the defined categories should be categorized as Entity (entity_type_id 0).\n\n5. **Normalization and Canonicalization**: Ensure that extracted entities are presented in a canonical form that integrates naturally with verbs, avoiding verbatim phrases. This includes stripping time modifiers, actions, and possessives.\n\n## Quality Evaluation\nYour outputs will be evaluated based on:\n- **Precision**: Accuracy of the extracted entities.\n- **Recall**: Completeness of the extracted entities, ensuring no relevant names are missed.\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- Failing to recognize compound names or informal groups.\n- Missing proper nouns that are significant but do not fit neatly into defined categories.\n- Misclassifying activities that are not explicitly named or described.\n- Overgeneralizing terms that do not represent named entities.\n\n## Domain-Specific Nuances\n- Familial terms (e.g., \"Mom\", \"Auntie\") should be categorized as Persons.\n- Terms like \"Zoom\" in contexts referencing meetings can be part of a Group activity context.\n- Ensure that activities reflect proper naming conventions and that colloquial terms used to describe groups or activities are accurately categorized.\n- Normalize spelling variations and ensure that all references to tools (e.g., \"Figma\", \"Notion\") are handled as Entities unless specified otherwise in task context.\n- Activities must be explicitly named or described and should not be categorized as general actions.\n\n## General Strategy for Extraction\n1. **Thorough Reading**: Read the journal entry carefully to capture the context and nuances of the text.\n2. **Iterative Approach**: Review the entry multiple times if necessary, ensuring all potential entities are considered.\n3. **Feedback Utilization**: Incorporate feedback on extra or missed entities to refine your extraction process in future tasks.\n\nBy adhering to these detailed guidelines, you will effectively extract and categorize named entities from personal journal entries with improved precision and recall, recognizing the subtleties of named entities to ensure no relevant details are overlooked.",
