Each entity must be represented as an object ExtractedEntity with two fields:\n- name: the canonical noun phrase exactly as it appears in the input (preserve original form, including casing, spacing, possessives, hyphenations, and multiword sequences)\n- entity_type_id: one of the four type identifiers\n  - 1 = Person\n  - 2 = Place\n  - 3 = Group\n  - 4 = Activity\n\nOutput\n- Output must be a Python-like list syntax containing one or more ExtractedEntity objects, e.g.:\n  extracted_entities=[ExtractedEntity(name='Example Name', entity_type_id=2), ExtractedEntity(name='Another Example', entity_type_id=4)]\n- For each episode_content, output exactly one extracted_entities list and nothing else (no commentary, justification, or metadata).\n\nExtraction rules (precision-first)\n1) Identify high-confidence named entities that plausibly function as subjects or objects of verbs in surrounding sentences.\n2) Only include entities that clearly map to exactly one type (Person, Place, Group, or Activity). If a term could belong to multiple types or the type is ambiguous, omit it.\n3) Do not include generic concepts, pronouns, or non-named concepts unless clearly used as a named entity in context.\n4) Do not include non-entities or false positives, and avoid overlapping extractions where a single term could be counted as multiple items.\n5) Preserve the exact textual form as it appears in the input. Do not normalize spacing, capitalization, or punctuation beyond preserving the original form.\n6) Multi-word names must be treated as a single entity (do not split into sub-entities). Keep internal spacing and capitalization.\n7) Possessives and hyphenated forms must be kept exactly as they appear (e.g., \"Auntie Rosa's\" should be considered as written if it qualifies as a named entity; otherwise omit if it becomes ambiguous).\n8) Entity-type guidance:\n   - Person (1): explicit individuals named in the text, or clearly referential proper names (e.g., \"Michael\", \"Mom\", \"Auntie Rosa\"). Use only when there is a clear canonical referent.\n   - Place (2): specific named locations, venues, buildings, or geographic places identifiable as proper nouns (e.g., \"Encore Academy\", \"Pinehurst\").\n   - Group (3): named collectives such as teams, clubs, advisory boards, or organizations (e.g., \"advisory board\", \"dance team\"). Do not include generic terms like \"the team\" unless there is a clearly named designation.\n   - Activity (4): named events, occasions, outings, or recurring routines that function as a noun in context (e.g., \"dance practice\", \"Asr prayer\", \"backgammon\" when used as a named activity). Treat recurring routines or titled activities as Activity when they function as a named event or ongoing practice.\n\nEdge handling and exclusions\n- Broad organizations or companies: include only if they map cleanly to one of the four types above; otherwise omit.\n- Titles of media (books, podcasts, shows) should be classified only if they clearly function as one of the four types in context (often as Activity if they represent a routine or event; otherwise omit if they do not clearly act as one of the four types).\n- If a term does not clearly meet a high-confidence threshold for any of the four types, omit it.\n- Do not include inferred entities that are not explicitly named in the text.\n\nQuality strategy\n- Use capitalization and context to determine type (Place vs Activity when ambiguous). Prefer Place for named venues/locations; prefer Activity for named events/routines.\n- If uncertain about a term’s classification, omit rather than risk a false positive.\n- Review for possible misclassifications that would violate the single-type, single-entity rule per item.\n- Ensure the output contains only the refined, high-confidence entities for that episode_content.\n\nIntegration tips\n- Scan for capitalized proper nouns and noun phrases that can be subjects or objects of verbs.\n- Maintain a consistent extraction style across all entries to enable reliable downstream processing.",
