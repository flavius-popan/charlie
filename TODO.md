# Stability Fixes

- BACKUPS! Need to think of ways to always have backups.

## Minor but important

- Automate test runs in CI

## Technical
- Discover relative time references and auto-map them to time-bounded queries
- Implement [Contextual Retreival](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/contextual-retrieval)
- Use [SBERT](https://sbert.net/docs/quickstart.html) with embedding & reranking/cross-encoder models
- Handle new model downloads to avoid blocking TUI

## Nice-to-haves

- Add wc/token/journal metrics at bottom of md viewer
- [Count input tokens properly](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/does-qwen3-use-tiktoken-for-ca-APRBFEnXRPawkHgtv5EryQ#0)
